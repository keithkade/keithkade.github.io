    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
    For the past two semesters, I have been an undergraduate researcher at the <a target="_blank" href="https://ecologylab.net/">Interface Ecology Lab</a>. Our lab focuses the way people create, explore, curate, and interact with digital media. To see some of what we do, I suggest checking out <a target="_blank" href="http://ideamache.ecologylab.net/">IdeaMÂCHÉ</a>. </p>
    <p>MICE shows off the the meta-metadata language our lab has created. This language consists of extraction rules for web pages and a number of "wrappers" that utilize those rules to extract metadata from web pages. Each of these wrappers is a part of a type system. We call this entire architecture <a target="_blank" href="http://ecologylab.net/research/bigsemantics/index.html">BigSemantics</a>, and it is open <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ecologylab/BigSemantics">source</a>.

    <p>
    IdeaMÂCHÉ is a tool that allows users to collect, organize, and share text, pictures, and links gathered from the web. Think Pinterest + Photoshop-lite. It is often used as a brainstorming tool or for presentations. It also takes advantage of BigSemantics and MICE, as each piece of web content has metadata associated with it that can be viewed from within a mache (shown in the screenshot below). If you try to view a mache, it will say you need a plugin, but feel free to go ahead. The plugin is only really neccessary if you want to create your own maches.

    <h2 id="secondTitle">What I do</h2>
    <p>I specifically have worked on a number of things during my time in the lab. I started by authoring wrappers for a number of art museum sites and some commerce sites. After that, I worked on calculating and visualizing usage statistics for IdeaMÂCHÉ using Javascript and D3. This was a part of an internal app that helps us understand the way people use the software.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently I am improving the <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ideam%C3%A2ch%C3%A9-extension/elkanacmmmdgbnhdjopfdeafchmhecbf?hl=en-US">IdeaMÂCHÉ Chrome Extension</a>. I added functionality to extract metadata from pages on the client side, a process that previously required a call to a Java-based service. Doing things client side has a number of advantages, such as being able to see dynamically generated parts of the DOM. In addition, I am building a "Monadic Metadata Viewer" for my Undergraduate Research Thesis. This viewer utilizes BigSementics to visualize networks of linked metadata. The network is shown as physically-based model, where similar nodes are closer together on the screen. For a better idea of what monadic exploration/visualization is check out recent work by <a target="_blank" href="http://mariandoerk.de/monadicexploration/">Marian Dörk</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/330">Bruno Latour</a>.
