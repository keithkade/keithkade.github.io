    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a Software Engineer residing in Austin, TX. I currently work on Giant Eagle's online grocery shopping platform after working at IBM since I completed undergrad. I did my undergrad at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, and I followed that up by getting a Master's Degree in CS from <a href="https://www-cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford</a> by taking classes part-time.

    <p>
    In addition to computers, I'm into music, golf, board games, comic books, and video games.
