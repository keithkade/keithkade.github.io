    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a Software Engineer residing in Austin, TX. I currently work on Yahoo Mail. Prior to that I worked at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gianteagle.com">Giant Eagle</a> and IBM. I did my undergrad at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, and I followed that up by getting a Master's Degree in CS from <a href="https://www-cs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford</a> by taking classes part-time.

    In addition to computers, I'm into music, golf, board games, video games, and comic books.
