After many half-hearted attempts, I learned that the most important thing for successfully bulking was finding foods that were 1) tasty and 2) convenient. Food with perfect macros is useless if you aren't willing to eat it. I've used these foods for two bulking periods, over which I gained more than 30 pounds. By no means did I follow a perfect formula, but I did achieve a weight that is healthier and that I am happier with.

This list will be tailored to my tastes and lifestyle but hopefully can inspire you a bit even if you don't love these foods. The main thing you need to do to succeed is find foods you enjoy that you can easily fit into your day-to-day life. For example: as someone who doesn't live alone, I focused more on snacks rather than overhauling my actual meals in order to not subject other people to my choices.

## Bulking foods

### Collagen Coffee

**Calories**: 40
**Protein**: 10g
**Carbs**: 0
**Fat**: 0

I got tired of standard whey protein shakes pretty quickly, but I never got tired was sneaking some collagen into my morning coffee. I still do this regardless of whether I'm actively bulking. I keep a container on the countertop next to my coffee maker and throw a scoop into my coffee each morning. You can adjust quantity based on personal preference and how you like the taste. I've tried a number of different brands, and do find that the more expensive stuff dissolves better. Bonus: If you take creatine toss that into your coffee as well.

### Clear protein powder

**Calories**: 80
**Protein**: 20g
**Carbs**: 0
**Fat**: 0

Another alternative to milky protein shakes are the more fruity clear protein powders. I find these way more pleasant and have no trouble drinking one each day. I usually go with MyProtein Clear Whey Isolate, but there are a number of brands out there. Find a flavor you like, and for some added nutritional value throw in a splash of some healthy juice like cranberry or pomegranate. I would prep these in bulk on the weekend so all I need to do is grab a shaker bottle from the fridge.

### Mochi

**Calories**: 115
**Protein**: 1g
**Carbs**: 28g
**Fat**: 0

Rice and beans have never been so tasty. Available at Asian food stores in a variety of flavors (exact nutrition info will vary), I keep these in my fridge/freezer and grab one or two throughout the day.

### Peanut chili crisp rice

**Calories**: 412
**Protein**: 9g
**Carbs**: 49g
**Fat**: 20g

While you are at an Asian grocery store, pick up some chili crisp as well. Lao Gan Ma is the classic, I've also enjoyed Fly By Jing. Then throw a spoonful of that on top of some leftover rice that you've warmed up and topped with peanuts and you have a delicious snack with lots of calories. Assuming 1 tbsp chili crisp, 2 tbsp peanuts, and 1 cup cooked white rice you get over 400 calories that are tasty and convenient. For bulking, spicy foods have the added benefit of making you thirsty. So go ahead and wash that down with milk or a protein shake.

### Chickpea Pasta

**Calories**: 190
**Protein**: 11g
**Carbs**: 35g
**Fat**: 3g

I find a lot of protein "replacement" foods to be not great, but chickpea pasta is an exception. Banza is a popular brand but others are tasty too. If you want a meatless but still high-protein dinner, chickpea pasta + sauce of choice + a bunch of parmesan will get you there.

### Protein Cereal

**Calories**: 120
**Protein**: 8g
**Carbs**: 18g
**Fat**: 1.5g

Another high-protein alternative that's tasty are the high-protein cereals. Three Wishes Chocolate is my brand and my flavor of choice is chocolate, but I've noticed more companies releasing their versions of this as well.

### Frozen Edamame

**Calories**: 130
**Protein**: 14g
**Carbs**: 12g
**Fat**: 3.5

Beans in general are great for bulking thanks to their protein and overall nutrient profile. Edamame (soybeans) are the king of beans for their protein. I found dried and canned beans inconvenient because I had to plan meals around them, but with frozen beans, you can use just what you need. Frozen edamame cooks in just five minutes. Tasty as a snack with some seasonings - garlic, ginger, sesame, etc. - or thrown in to stir fry.

### Jerky or Biltong

**Calories**: 70
**Protein**: 9
**Carbs**: 6
**Fat**: 0.5

For whatever reason, this is a "never get tired of" food for me. Almost pure protein and no prep required - what more could you ask for? Lots of brands are available with different flavors and price points. Find some that you like and buy in bulk whenever there is a sale.

### Cheese

**Calories**: 110
**Protein**: 9g
**Carbs**: 1g
**Fat**: 8g

Very calorie-dense and a good source of protein. And IMO worth it to pay a bit more for something tastier. Macros can vary, example I've provided is for Parmesan. I usually paired with some basic water crackers.

### Tinned Fish

**Calories**: 230
**Protein**: 16g
**Carbs**: 0g
**Fat**: 18g


For a bigger snack, oftentimes immediately post-workout, I reach for a can of tinned fish. King Oscar sardines in olive oil are a great place to start. That's the nutrition info I've shown. Pair with hot sauce or a spice mix and some crackers and you are set. Can go with something skinless and boneless if you want leaner, but the fat calories of the skin on ones are worth it as they are great for overall nutrition.

### Dark Chocolate

**Calories**: 160
**Protein**: 2g
**Carbs**: 14g
**Fat**: 11g

This one is only partially a joke. You'll inevitably be tempted to "dirty bulk" and just eat junk food to hit calorie goals. Doing so can make you feel worse overall if you aren't careful. If you do want to grab something sweet after a meal, go for some dark chocolate. Overall your body will thank you compared to if you had reached for a typical candy bar. I also treated it as a nice reward if I managed to reach the end of the day with room to spare in my target calories from fats.
